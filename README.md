# First-databaze
### Structure
The databaze was written in c++ programming language. It includes 2 Header and 2 executable files besides the main executable file. 
Initial data about the department and employees is read from files '''inputfile.txt''' and '''secondinputfile.txt'''.
### Possibilities
Next we can keep cadastral records of all employees and departments using the the console interface.
The programm provides opportunities to add, to print to consol or to delete employees and departments. Also one of the possibilities is to exit the program.
### Technologies
I use set from STL containers to add subjects.

*After adding employees and departments, they are sorted by name and department head*.
|subjects  |sorting        |
|----------|:-------------:|
|employees |name           |
|department|department_name|
